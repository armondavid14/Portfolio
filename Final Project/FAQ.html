<h3><dt>What was the reason for creating this website?</dt></h3>

regular price laptops a chance to find a cheap laptop that they can use for 
whatever they need it for.</dd>

and kinds, such as regular pc laptops, macbooks, and netbooks.</dd> 
<h3><dt>Why am I only allowed to make two purchases at a time?</dt></h3>

website and we are still lacking the funds to deal with a large amount of orders. 
We hope to have more stock and a bigger variety of brands in the future as we grow.</dd>
