<p>Macbooks are laptops that were made by the technology company Apple. 
They differ from Windows laptops in that they have a different operating system, called MAC OS. 
They are considered to be more expensive than Windows laptops, but also are more compatible
with other Apple products, such as iPhones, which many people own.</p>
