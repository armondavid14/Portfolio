        <li><a href="Final Project/finalproject.html" >E-Commerce Website:</a> Created a website made of HTML and CSS code that also featured minor JavaScript inputs. It was a school project designed to be an e-commerce site to sell products of our choosing, and the products I chose to sell were laptops for college students. The site contained a link to a virtual store where the products could be ordered, however no real transactions ever took place, and the virtual store link has been shut down in the time since then. The site was tested and worked on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer. </li>
