            <a href="Final Project/finalproject.html"><h2>E-Commerce Website:</h2></a> 
            <div>
                <br><p>Created a website made of HTML and CSS code that also featured minor JavaScript inputs. It was a school project designed to be an e-commerce site to sell products of our choosing, and the products I chose to sell were laptops for college students. The site contained a link to a virtual store where the products could be ordered, however no real transactions ever took place, and the virtual store link has been shut down in the time since then. The site was tested and worked on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer.</p>

            <h2>Raspberry Pi: </h2>
            <div>
                <br>Created ARM programs that ran on a Raspberry Pi while working with a group of four fellow computer science majors. During this project, my group members and I were given an example program in ARM that did various mathematical tasks, such as arithmetic problems or finding statistical data for a large group of numbers and were told to run it on a Raspberry Pi and debug it to find any errors in it. We then were instructed to make our own programs which were designed to be superior versions of the example programs.
            </div>
            <h2>Android App: </h2>
            <div>
                 <br>Created an app used to track student attendance while working with a group of fellow students. We used a virtual database using React code where students were able to input their student information, and the database would be updated with that information to show their attendance. This program was used by students in Georgia State University.
